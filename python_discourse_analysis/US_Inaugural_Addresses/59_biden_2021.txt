Joe Biden 	1/20/2021	 Chief Justice Roberts, Vice President Harris, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer, Leader McConnell, Vice President Pence, distinguished guests, and my fellow Americans. This is America’s day.This is democracy’s day.A day of history and hope.Of renewal and resolve.Through a crucible for the ages America has been tested anew and America has risen to the challenge.Today, we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of democracy.The will of the people has been heard and the will of the people has been heeded.We have learned again that democracy is precious.Democracy is fragile.And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed.So now, on this hallowed ground where just days ago violence sought to shake this Capitol’s very foundation, we come together as one nation, under God, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries.We look ahead in our uniquely American way – restless, bold, optimistic – and set our sights on the nation we know we can be and we must be.I thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here.I thank them from the bottom of my heart.You know the resilience of our Constitution and the strength of our nation.As does President Carter, who I spoke to last night but who cannot be with us today, but whom we salute for his lifetime of service.I have just taken the sacred oath each of these patriots took — an oath first sworn by George Washington.But the American story depends not on any one of us, not on some of us, but on all of us.On “We the People” who seek a more perfect Union.This is a great nation and we are a good people.Over the centuries through storm and strife, in peace and in war, we have come so far. But we still have far to go.We will press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and possibility.Much to repair.Much to restore.Much to heal.Much to build.And much to gain.Few periods in our nation’s history have been more challenging or difficult than the one we’re in now.A once-in-a-century virus silently stalks the country.It’s taken as many lives in one year as America lost in all of World War II.Millions of jobs have been lost.Hundreds of thousands of businesses closed.A cry for racial justice some 400 years in the making moves us. The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer.A cry for survival comes from the planet itself. A cry that can’t be any more desperate or any more clear.And now, a rise in political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat.To overcome these challenges – to restore the soul and to secure the future of America – requires more than words.It requires that most elusive of things in a democracy:Unity.Unity.In another January in Washington, on New Year’s Day 1863, Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.When he put pen to paper, the President said, “If my name ever goes down into history it will be for this act and my whole soul is in it.”My whole soul is in it.Today, on this January day, my whole soul is in this:Bringing America together.Uniting our people.And uniting our nation.I ask every American to join me in this cause.Uniting to fight the common foes we face:Anger, resentment, hatred.Extremism, lawlessness, violence.Disease, joblessness, hopelessness.With unity we can do great things. Important things.We can right wrongs.We can put people to work in good jobs.We can teach our children in safe schools.We can overcome this deadly virus.We can reward work, rebuild the middle class, and make health care secure for all.
